## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing us directly or through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature.

### Preferred Method: GitHub Security Advisories

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/your-username/n8n-r8/security) of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the vulnerability report form
4. Submit the report

### Alternative Method: Email

Send an email to: **security@your-domain.com** (replace with actual email)

Include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

## 🔍 Security Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the reported vulnerability
3. **Timeline**: We aim to provide an initial response within 5 business days
4. **Resolution**: We will work on a fix and coordinate disclosure timing with you
5. **Credit**: We will credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### 🔐 Authentication & Credentials
- **Change default passwords immediately** in production environments
- Use **strong, unique passwords** for all services
- Store credentials in **environment variables** or secure secret management systems
- Never commit `.env` files or credentials to version control
- Regularly rotate passwords and API keys

#### 🌐 Network Security
- **Use HTTPS/TLS** in production environments
- Configure **firewall rules** to restrict access
- Use **VPN or private networks** for sensitive deployments
- Implement **rate limiting** and DDoS protection
- Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity

#### 🐳 Docker Security
- **Pin Docker image versions** (avoid `:latest` in production)
- **Run containers as non-root users** where possible
- **Set resource limits** to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Regularly update** Docker images and base systems
- **Scan images** for known vulnerabilities
- **Use Docker secrets** for sensitive data

#### 📊 Monitoring & Logging
- **Enable comprehensive logging** for all services
- **Monitor for suspicious activity** and failed login attempts
- **Set up alerts** for security events
- **Regularly review logs** for anomalies
- **Implement log retention** policies

#### 💾 Data Protection
- **Encrypt data at rest** and in transit
- **Regular backups** with encryption
- **Test backup restoration** procedures
- **Implement data retention** policies
- **Secure backup storage** locations

### For Contributors

#### 🔒 Secure Development
- **Never commit secrets** or credentials
- **Use environment variables** for configuration
- **Validate all inputs** and sanitize outputs
- **Follow principle of least privilege**
- **Implement proper error handling**
- **Use secure coding practices**

#### 🧪 Security Testing
- **Test authentication** and authorization mechanisms
- **Validate input sanitization**
- **Check for common vulnerabilities** (OWASP Top 10)
- **Review dependencies** for known vulnerabilities
- **Test SSL/TLS configurations**

## 🔧 Security Configuration Checklist

### Production Deployment

#### Essential Security Measures
- [ ] Changed all default passwords and secrets
- [ ] Configured HTTPS/TLS with valid certificates
- [ ] Set up firewall rules and network security
- [ ] Enabled authentication for all services
- [ ] Configured secure headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implemented backup and recovery procedures

#### Docker Security
- [ ] Pinned all Docker image versions
- [ ] Configured resource limits for all containers
- [ ] Running containers as non-root users where possible
- [ ] Removed unnecessary capabilities and privileges
- [ ] Configured security contexts appropriately
- [ ] Enabled Docker content trust (if applicable)

#### Network Security
- [ ] Configured internal Docker networks
- [ ] Restricted external port exposure
- [ ] Implemented reverse proxy with security headers
- [ ] Set up rate limiting and DDoS protection
- [ ] Configured VPN or private network access
- [ ] Enabled network monitoring and logging

#### Data Security
- [ ] Encrypted data at rest and in transit
- [ ] Configured secure database connections
- [ ] Implemented proper backup encryption
- [ ] Set up secure credential storage
- [ ] Configured data retention policies
- [ ] Enabled audit logging

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Default Configurations
- **Default credentials** are set for development convenience
- **HTTP is used by default** - HTTPS must be configured manually
- **Basic authentication** is enabled but should be supplemented with additional security measures
- **Internal networks** are configured but external access controls must be implemented

### Dependencies
- **N8N Community Edition** has its own security considerations
- **Third-party Docker images** may have vulnerabilities
- **Node.js dependencies** in custom nodes should be regularly updated
- **System packages** in Docker images should be kept current

### Deployment Environments
- **Development configurations** are not suitable for production
- **Example credentials** must be changed before deployment
- **Debug modes** should be disabled in production
- **Monitoring** should be enabled for security events
