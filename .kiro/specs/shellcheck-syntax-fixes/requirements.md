# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses all cascading ShellCheck syntax errors in the n8n-r8 project that are causing CI/CD pipeline failures. The project has multiple shell scripts with various ShellCheck violations including unused variables, non-constant source paths, and missing source directives. These issues need to be systematically resolved to ensure the CI pipeline passes and maintain code quality standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all shell scripts to pass ShellCheck validation, so that the CI/CD pipeline runs successfully without linting failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ShellCheck runs on all shell scripts THEN it SHALL return zero exit code with no errors or warnings
2. WHEN the CI/CD pipeline executes the "Lint shell scripts" step THEN it SHALL pass without any ShellCheck violations
3. WHEN running `find . -name "*.sh" -type f -not -path "*/node_modules/*" | xargs shellcheck` THEN it SHALL produce no output indicating issues

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper source directives in shell scripts, so that ShellCheck can follow and validate sourced files correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a shell script sources another file THEN it SHALL include proper shellcheck source directives
2. WHEN ShellCheck encounters a source statement THEN it SHALL NOT produce SC1091 or SC1090 warnings
3. WHEN sourcing relative paths THEN the script SHALL use explicit shellcheck source comments to guide validation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused variables to be properly handled, so that the codebase maintains clean and efficient code without false warnings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN color variables are defined in helper scripts THEN they SHALL be properly exported or marked as used
2. WHEN ShellCheck encounters variable definitions THEN it SHALL NOT produce SC2034 warnings for legitimately used variables
3. WHEN variables are intentionally unused THEN they SHALL be properly documented with disable directives

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test scripts to run locally without syntax errors, so that I can validate changes before pushing to CI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `./tests/run_tests.sh` locally THEN it SHALL execute successfully without syntax errors
2. WHEN executing individual test files THEN they SHALL run without shell syntax issues
3. WHEN sourcing helper files in tests THEN the sourcing SHALL work correctly in both local and CI environments

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent shell script formatting and best practices, so that the codebase maintains high quality and readability standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN shell scripts are written THEN they SHALL follow consistent formatting and best practices
2. WHEN functions are defined THEN they SHALL have proper opening and closing braces
3. WHEN scripts are executed THEN they SHALL have appropriate shebang lines and shell directives
4. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN it SHALL follow shell scripting best practices

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI pipeline to provide clear feedback on shell script issues, so that I can quickly identify and fix problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ShellCheck finds issues THEN the CI pipeline SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
2. WHEN shell script validation fails THEN the pipeline SHALL fail fast and provide specific file and line information
3. WHEN all shell scripts are valid THEN the CI pipeline SHALL proceed to subsequent steps without delays
